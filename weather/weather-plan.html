            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The client would like a web based weather app created. The purpose of the site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways.  The initial landing page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding information given by the browser.  The second is weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a search string.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split between mobile devices and laptops.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Audience Goals</h2>
            <br>
            <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>
